        <h2 id="003">Education Major – Music Studies</h2>

        <p>Education Major equips students to be a competent, versatile and creative music teacher with a firm foundation in musical understanding and professional practices to meet their future professional needs in both primary and secondary schools. The curriculum covers four areas: Music History, Theory and Composition, Performance, and Music Education. The study in the Music discipline facilitates students to become professional musicians through actively and progressively engaging themselves in music study in the integration of critical listening, creating and performing. The Music Education area provides specialised training in contemporary methods and approaches to develop the skills, knowledge and attitude for teachers to work effectively and professionally in today's schools. Whilst students can further enhance their first instrument during the studies, the programme also facilitates students’ learning of a second instrument. Further, an emphasis is laid on learning through participating in various performing groups, music workshops and master classes.</p>


        
        
        
        <h2 id="004">Discipline Major – Creative Arts and Culture (CAC) Studies</h2>

        <p>The Discipline Major courses equip students with a broad understanding of the diversity of the arts in the cultural and creative industries. The Foundation Seminar in the Arts and three Foundation Courses expose students to dance, drama, theatre and media. The Compulsory Courses are progressive in nature, with six courses in Cultural Studies and Arts Management. These courses emphasize the significance of the arts and creativity, cultural literacy, arts management, and the interconnectedness between related disciplines beyond the arts. The five Music Subject Focus courses are designed to sharpen students’ skills and knowledge in the subject discipline and to consolidate students’ understanding of the art form, both theoretically and practically. Students may also select from a spectrum of Major Elective Courses, which address relevant issues concerning the arts in a variety of contexts and settings. These courses adopt an integrative and interdisciplinary approach, underpinned by the belief that the arts relate closely to studies in other disciplines such as Literature, Sociology, and Cultural Theory.</p>



        <h2 id="005">Internship</h2>

        <p>The Internship is a 6-cp compulsory experiential and professional learning component of the programme. Students are expected to work as an intern in a relevant organization or company for pre-determined period of time. Students can further cultivate skills and knowledge developed during coursework by working within the cultural and creative industries. Through this work-based experience, students can have first-hand exposure to the operations of an organization, and reflect on the practices in the real working environment.</p>



        <h2 id="006">Education Studies</h2>

        <p>Education Studies gives students the chance to study teaching and learning from an interdisciplinary perspective. Students will study early childhood/school education from psychological, sociological, philosophical, pedagogical and other perspectives. Students will develop a range of skills necessary for professional practice, such as problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, communication, social interaction, ethical decision making and global perspectives. Education Studies helps students appreciate the importance of professional excellence, ethical responsibility and innovation to the role of a teacher. We aim for our graduates to become beginning teachers who are caring and competent, intellectually enthusiastic, socially committed, and globally aware.</p>




        <h2 id="007">Field Experience</h2>
        
        <p>Students will be placed in schools which are important sites for learning to teach and where they will interpret, generate, interact and experiment with theory:</p>

        <h2 id="008">General Education</h2>
        
        <p>The EdUHK’s General Education programme prepares students to be active agents of change, by broadening their intellectual horizons, helping them make connections among different areas of knowledge and between their formal studies and life outside the classroom, and strengthening their capacity for sound thinking and good judgement. It offers a varied but balanced mix of individual courses across a range of subject areas and disciplines, set within an integrated structure of (i) General Education Foundation Course, (ii) Experiential Learning, (iii) General Education Breadth Courses, and (iv) University ePortfolio with a total of 16 credit points (cps).</p>
        
        <h3>(i) General Education Foundation Course (4 cps)</h3>
        
        <p>General Education Foundation Course (GEFC) is a 4-cp course that will run in Semesters 1 and 2, and will be taken by all first-year students at EdUHK. In view of the fact that Year 1 students usually lack the writing, thinking, presentation and research (inquiry) skills required for further academic pursuits, the 4-cp GEFC will build in a new 1 credit point skill-based development/ thematic course to equip them better for their intellectual development in the university context in Year 1 Semester 1. In Semester 2 of Year 1, students are still required to take part in the 3-cp GEFC lectures delivered by Chair Professors/ Professors and external Guest Lecturers on a wide variety of topics/ themes/ issues focusing on the domains of humanities, social sciences, science and environment as what have been practiced in recent years. These lectures are substantiated by small class tutorials for the purpose of building communities of dialogue and inquiry that foster the intellectual growth of students as reflective thinkers deliberating issues of importance to their own lives, to society and to the world as a whole.</p>     
        
        <h3>(ii) Experiential Learning (3 cps)</h3>
        
        <p>Experiential Learning (EL) is composed of a 3-cp Co-curricular Service Learning Course (CSLC)</p>  
          
        <p>The 3-cp CSLC provides students with an opportunity to engage in learning in action and through co-curricular learning activities with direct service elements in real-life or work-place context while complementing, connecting with, and mirroring their learning experiences derived from formal curriculum.</p>  
           
        <p>CSLCs will be made available for all undergraduate students, except final year students of non-BEd programmes</p>      
             
        <h3>(iii) General Education Breadth Courses (6 cps)</h3>
        
        <p>Under the new curriculum (from 2019/20 onwards), the General Education Breadth Courses (GEBCs) (6 cps) are composed, Positive and Values Education (PAVE) Course and General Education Interdisciplinary Course (GEIC) (Level 4), students have to take one of each component for fulfilling the GEBCs (6 cps) requirement.</p>  
          
        <p>These courses aim to equip students better for the study of the ontological, epistemological and/or methodological issues in a wide variety of disciplines. Side by side with these existing components, a new 3-cp GEIC (Level 4) will be offered on cross-faculty and/ or cross-departmental basis for students from Year 2 Semester 2 to Year 3, in order to enable them to appreciate the complexity of issues and problems that transcend disciplinary boundaries and make sense of them through dialogues across or integration of disciplines.</p>  
           
        <p>Students are allowed to take PAVE Course after the completion of GEFC or concurrently with GEFC in Year 1 Semester 2 if they are interested and their curriculum schedules allow. After the completion of any PAVE Course, students are allowed to take the GEIC from Year 2 Semester 2 to Year 3 Semester 1.</p>      

        <h3>(iv) University ePortfolio (3 cps)</h3>
        
        <p>After the completion of these courses, students will take a 3-cp course at Consolidation Level to complete their University ePortfolios normally before the final year. Based on their on-going evidence-based reflections on learning since Year One through Years Two-Three/Four, students are required to complete the construction of their University ePortfolios that are made up of the artifacts and evidence derived from a wide variety of learning experiences (e.g. Language Enhancement, GEFC, PAVE Course and GEIC, Majors, Minors/Electives, Field Experience/Internship, Exchange Programme, CSLCs, etc.). It provides an intellectual platform for students to synthesize their learning experiences garnered from the academic journey at the EdUHK by critically reflecting on the values and significance of what they have learned, making connections to their lives, and charting or imagining their own future.</p>  
          
        <p>Students are allowed to take University ePortfolio after the completion of all General Education Breadth Courses required. Normally, students are expected to complete their UePortfolios in the year before the final year. Also, they have to take the University ePortfolio in the year of study assigned by individual programmes.</p>
