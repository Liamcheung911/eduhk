        <p class="desc-text"><i>*If you need to obtain a student visa or entry permit to study in Hong Kong, then you are regarded
          as a non-local student (subject to confirmation from the Hong Kong Immigration Department).</i></p><br>

        <h3>Immersion Programme</h3>
        <p>Students admitted to the Bachelor of Education (Chinese Language / English Language) programme are required to
          attend a compulsory Immersion Programme. While Immersion Programmes are heavily subsidized, students are still
          required to contribute no less than 18% of the best estimated cost of the Immersion Programmes ("student contribution").
          The estimated cost of the Immersion Programmes for students admitted to the 2019/20 cohort is not available yet
          as it is subject to a variety of factors such as changes to the immersion programme cost as a result of inflation
          and programme duration, the prevailing airfare, fuel surcharge and taxes, and the exchange rate. The student contribution
          is thus not available. For reference purpose, student contribution for students admitted to the 2016/17 cohort
          are HK$5,850 for attending Chinese Language Immersion Programme; and student contribution for students admitted
          to the 2017/18 cohort are HK$11,300 for attending English Language Immersion Programme. Students are strongly reminded
          that the student contribution for the 2019/20 cohort may vary and the aforementioned student contribution amounts
          should be taken as reference only.</p><br>


        <h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
        <p>Students with financial needs may apply for grants and/or loans under the following schemes.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Tertiary Student Finance Scheme - Publicly-funded Programmes (TSFS) (For full-time
              students only)</span><p>The TSFS is administered by the Government's Working Family and Student Financial Assistance
              Agency, and is a means-tested scheme that provides assistance in the form of a grant and/or a loan to full-time
              students engaged in University Grants Committee-funded programmes. The grant is to cover tuition fees, academic
              expenses and compulsory Students’ Union fees, whilst the loan is for living expenses and is interest-bearing.
              Interest is charged upon graduation or termination of full-time study. Successful applicants of TSFS may also
              apply for a travel subsidy, and those attending compulsory overseas field trips/immersion programmes may receive
              an additional grant.</p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Financial Assistance Scheme for Post-secondary Students (FASP) (For full-time
              students only)</span><p>Similar to the TSFS, the FASP is also administered by the Government's Working Family
              and Student Financial Assistance Agency. It provides a grant and/or a loan to full-time students, aged 30 or
              below, engaged in locally accredited, self-financing post-secondary education programmes at the level of higher
              diploma or degree. The grant is to cover tuition fees and academic expenses, whilst the loan is for living
              expenses and is interest-bearing. Interest is charged upon graduation or termination of full-time study. Successful
              applicants of FASP may also apply for a travel subsidy.</p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Non-means-tested Loan Schemes (NLSFT, NLSPS and ENLS)</span>
            <p>Also administered by the Government's Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency, the NLSFT and
              NLSPS provide financial assistance in the form of a loan to complement the TSFS and FASP, respectively. Loans
              from NLSFT and NLSPS are solely used to settle tuition fees. The ENLS is the extended version of the NLSFT/NLSPS
              and provides loans to eligible students who are not covered under the TSFS or FASP to settle tuition fees.</p>
            <p>All three schemes operate on a full-cost recovery basis. Interest is charged once the loan is drawn down and
              throughout the repayment period until the loan is fully repaid. An administration fee to cover the full costs
              of processing and administering the NLS loan(s) is/are chargeable for each application, and annually thereafter
              until the NLS loan(s) and the interests are fully repaid.</p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Hostel Subsidy</span>
            <p>Hostel subsidy is offered under the Government’s Community Care Fund (CCF) Assistance Programme. Those undergraduates
              who have passed the means test of TSFS or FASP (i.e. with grant offered) and confirmed to have resided in student
              hostels provided by their institutions for at least 75% of the time during the semesters are eligible for the
              hostel subsidy. The subsidy is to be disbursed on semester basis. Eligible students need not file separate
              applications for the hostel subsidy. The amount of subsidy will be equal to the hostel fee payable or <span
                class="bg-danger text-white font-weight-bold">
                per year/ $4,520 per semester (TBC)</span>, whichever is lower. The actual amount of subsidy receivable by
              each eligible undergraduate is to be determined with respect to the student’s level of assistance assessed
              in the means test. The amount will be credited to the designated bank accounts of the eligible students by
              autopay. Please visit WFSFAA’s website for the details of the Hostel Subsidy at <a href="http://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/eng/schemes/ccf_hs.htm"
                target="_blank">http://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/eng/schemes/ccf_hs.htm</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Academic Expenses Grant for Needy Students</span>
            <p>The Commission on Poverty approved on 12 June 2014 the allocation of funds from the Community Care Fund (CCF)
              for providing an additional academic expenses grant for needy students pursing locally - accredited self-financing
              post-secondary programmes. Each eligible student will be offered an additional academic expenses grant up to<span
                class="bg-danger text-white font-weight-bold">
                $2,250 (TBC) </span>in the 2018/19 academic year. The actual amount receivable by each eligible student is
