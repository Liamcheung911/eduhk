                <p>
The BAFS Major aims to produce well-qualified teachers who are equipped with the competence to teach business subjects in secondary schools. The curriculum is built upon a contemporary business curriculum structure, which was planned in line with the fast-changing local and global contexts. It embraces a whole range of business related-disciplines, including (1) Business Foundations, (2) Accounting, (3) Management and (4) Financial Studies, and their complex interrelationships in the theoretical and practical aspects. <b><u>Business Foundations</u></b> incorporates legal and ethical issues in business, Hong Kong and global economy in order to provide a solid grounding in BAFS studies. <b><u>Accounting</u></b> essentially covers the financial and managerial accounting. <b><u>Management</u></b> comprises entrepreneurship, organizational management, human resources and marketing management studies. <b><u>Financial Studies</u></b> cover personal financial planning, financial management and financial statement analysis. In particular, <b><i>professional excellence, ethical responsibility and innovation</i></b> are strongly emphasised and integrated throughout the Major in view of their importance in both the business and education fields. Positive values and attitudes of students will be highly expected and fully cultivated throughout the Major courses.</p>
<p>
To enhance students' integrative and creative thinking in the technological advancement of business, an interdisciplinary course, <b><i>"Technology in Business and Creativity"</i></b>, will be provided in the Major.  Moreover, students will be able to pursue an in-depth study on either <b><i>“Investment” or “Strategic Management”</i></b> according to their interests and inclinations. Both formal and informal learning opportunities will be provided to students so as to keep abreast with the latest trends in business and education fields. More importantly, students will be equipped with a multiplicity of teaching pedagogies and strategies for business-related studies that can deepen junior and senior secondary school pupils’ holistic understanding of the business and workplace environment.</p>

                <p>Education Studies gives students the chance to study teaching and learning from an interdisciplinary perspective. Students will study early childhood/school education from psychological, sociological, philosophical, pedagogical and other perspectives. Students will develop a range of skills necessary for professional practice, such as problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, communication, social interaction, ethical decision making and global perspectives. Education Studies helps students appreciate the importance of professional excellence, ethical responsibility and innovation to the role of a teacher. We aim for our graduates to become beginning teachers who are caring and competent, intellectually enthusiastic, socially committed, and globally aware.</p>

                <p>The EdUHK’s General Education programme prepares students to be active agents of change, by broadening their intellectual horizons, helping them make connections among different areas of knowledge and between their formal studies and life outside the classroom, and strengthening their capacity for sound thinking and good judgement. It offers a varied but balanced mix of individual courses across a range of subject areas and disciplines, set within an integrated structure of (i) General Education Foundation Course, (ii) Experiential Learning, (iii) General Education Breadth Courses, and (iv) University ePortfolio with a total of 22 credit points (cps).</p>

                            <span class="font-weight-bold">General Education Foundation Course</span> (4 cps)
                            <p>General Education Foundation Course (GEFC) is a 4-cp course that will run in Semesters 1 and 2, and will be taken by all first-year students at EdUHK. In view of the fact that Year 1 students usually lack the writing, thinking, presentation and research (inquiry) skills required for further academic pursuits, the 4-cp GEFC will build in a new 1 credit point skill-based development/ thematic course to equip them better for their intellectual development in the university context in Year 1 Semester 1. In Semester 2 of Year 1, students are still required to take part in the 3-cp GEFC lectures delivered by Chair Professors/ Professors and external Guest Lecturers on a wide variety of topics/ themes/ issues focusing on the domains of humanities, social sciences, science and environment as what have been practiced in recent years. These lectures are substantiated by small class tutorials for the purpose of building communities of dialogue and inquiry that foster the intellectual growth of students as reflective thinkers deliberating issues of importance to their own lives, to society and to the world as a whole.</p>

                            <p>Experiential Learning (EL) is composed of a 3-cp Co-curricular Service Learning Course (CSLC) and a 3-cp Experiential Learning Course (ELC) which will be offered by departments under the GE domain. Students have to take one of each component for fulfilling the EL (6 cps) requirement.</p>
                            <p>The 3-cp CSLC provides students with an opportunity to engage in learning in action and through co-curricular learning activities with direct service elements in real-life or work-place context while complementing, connecting with, and mirroring their learning experiences derived from formal curriculum. The 3-cp ELC encourages students to learn through experimentation, observation, reflection and (re-) conceptualization while undertaking a wide variety of activities, such as creative work, field studies, projects, thematic overseas trips, outward-bound training etc. These courses enrich students’ learning experiences and skills through learning, thinking and reflecting on practice, in practice and for practice, while exposing them to authentic and real-life contexts.</p>
                            <p>CSLCs and ELCs will be made available for
all undergraduate students, except final year students of non-BEd
programmes.</p>

                            <p>Under the new curriculum (from 2019/20 onwards), the General Education Breadth Courses (GEBCs) (9 cps) are composed of General Education Breadth Learning Strands (1-3) (GELS) (Level 1-2), Positive and Values Education (PAVE) Course and General Education Interdisciplinary Course (GEIC) (Level 4), students have to take one of each component for fulfilling the GEBCs (9 cps) requirement.</p>
                            <p>These courses aim to equip students better for the study of the ontological, epistemological and/or methodological issues in a wide variety of disciplines. Side by side with these existing components, a new 3-cp GEIC (Level 4) will be offered on cross-faculty and/ or cross-departmental basis for students from Year 2 Semester 2 to Year 3, in order to enable them to appreciate the complexity of issues and problems that transcend disciplinary boundaries and make sense of them through dialogues across or integration of disciplines.</p>
                            <p>Students are allowed to take GELS and PAVE Course after the completion of GEFC or concurrently with GEFC in Year 1 Semester 2 if they are interested and their curriculum schedules allow. After the completion of any GELS or
PAVE Course, students are allowed to take the GEIC from Year 2 Semester 2
to Year 3 Semester 1</p>

                            <p>After the completion of these courses, students will take a 3-cp course at Consolidation Level to complete their University ePortfolios normally before the final year. Based on their on-going evidence-based reflections on learning since Year One through Years Two-Three/Four, students are required to complete the construction of their University ePortfolios that are made up of the artifacts and evidence derived from a wide variety of learning experiences (e.g. Language Enhancement, GEFC, GELS, PAVE Course and GEIC, Majors, Minors/Electives, Field Experience/Internship, Exchange Programme, CSLCs, ELCs etc.). It provides an intellectual platform for students to synthesize their learning experiences garnered from the academic journey at the EdUHK by critically reflecting on the values and significance of what they have learned, making connections to their lives, and charting or imagining their own future.</p>
                            <p>Students are allowed to take University ePortfolio after the completion of all General Education Breadth Courses required. Normally, students are expected to complete their University ePortfolios in the year before the final year. Also, they have to take the University ePortfolio in the year of study assigned by individual programmes.</p>
