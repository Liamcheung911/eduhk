        <h2 id="003">Major Courses</h2>

        <p>The primary purpose of the <span class="font-weight-bold">Foundation Course</span>, Basic Principles of Psychology, is to expose students to the major areas in the science of psychology, equipping students with a base and working knowledge of key areas, persons, events and issues in the broad discipline of psychology.</p>

        <p>The <span class="font-weight-bold">Core Courses</span> aim to introduce students to the content, methods, and applications of modern psychology, covering topics that represent the substantive areas (i.e., lifespan development, social psychology, personality, and abnormal psychology, biological psychology, cognitive psychology, learning theories and processes), methodological (i.e., research methods and statistical methods), and practical side of psychology.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of the <span class="font-weight-bold">Major Elective</span> Courses is to provide students an opportunity to diversify and extend the knowledge and skills gained from the Core Courses. The Major Electives serve three areas of concentration (refer to the next session for detailed explanation). Four Major Elective courses are designated for each concentration. For students who do not opt for the concentration scheme, the range of major electives serves as a platform to broaden their knowledge base in psychology.</p>        


        <h2 id="004">Concentration Scheme</h2>

        <p>It is desirable for psychology students to acquire more advanced knowledge of the field and the relevance of psychology to community needs, in addition to the general overview provided by the core courses. Therefore, the curriculum provides a concentration scheme so as to balance the breadth of content in core areas and research methods with opportunities for concentration in areas that are relevant to the needs of the community. Studnets may opt for one of the three areas of concentration. Each concentration involves a series of courses plus an Industrial Attachment at local agencies or an Honours Project. Through consultation with their faculty advisor, students will be able to find the concentration that best matches their interests, training goals, and career aspirations. The three areas of concentration are:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>School Psychology</li>
          <li>Health Psychology</li>
          <li>Human Relations and Communication</li>
        </ul>                 



        <h2 id="005">Industrial Attachment</h2>

        <p>Given our concern with both science and practice, an overarching curricular theme is to integrate the two. Thus, one of the special features of the curriculum is the concentration-specific Industrial Attachment scheme, i.e., an industrial attachment that is embedded in and integrated with the theory and research of the specific concentration area. In the attachment, students will have the opportunity to apply the psychological knowledge they have learnt in the classroom to the authentic work environment. The attachment period spans across the two semesters in the final year of study and students have to complete 200 attachment hours at a local agency. Depending on the work nature and the setting, the student's duties will be determined together by the agency supervisor and the teaching instructor, under a set of learning outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>Each student accepted for the attachment scheme will be supervised by a Site Supervisor and an Attachment Tutor as assigned by the agency and the Department respectively. The Site Supervisor will oversee and monitor the student's work and provide suitable professional guidance to the student on work-related matters during the attachment period. The Attachment Tutor will provide guidance and advice to the student before and during the attachment through pre-attachment workshops and personal mentorship. The Site Supervisor and the Attachment Tutor will work together to monitor and evaluate students' performance. The attachment coordinator will liaise with industrial partners and oversee the arrangement and implementation of the attachment, ensuring the aims of the attachment are met and the learning outcomes are achieved.</p>
        

        <h2 id="006">Honours Project</h2>

        <p>Senior psychology majors are offered an opportunity to pull together what they have learned in their previous coursework and use this integrating experience to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in psychology within the scope of a selected topic of personal interest. Students are expected to develop, plan and execute independent research under the guidance and supervision of a faculty member to examine specific problems or questions in psychology. The Attachment and the Honours Project form a capstone sequence wherein students have to integrate various aspects of their learning into a coherent product in applied work and in research respectively. For students who opt for a concentration and wish to use the Honours Project to satisfy the requirements for the concentration scheme, the Honours Project has to be conducted on a topic related to the concentration area, and may make use of the attachment setting for data collection. Other students may conduct an Honours Project on any topic related to psychology.</p>



        <h2 id="007">Electives</h2>

        <p>The Electives of the programme provide flexibility of choice for students to diversify and extend the knowledge and skills gained from their Major studies, as well as to encourage them to expose to different study areas for all-round development. Students can choose a wide range of courses offered by the University in accordance with their own background and study interests, as well as their future aspirations for their career and further studies. Students may also choose to take a Second Major (30 cps) or one/two Minor(s) (15/ 30 cps).</p>


        <h2 id="008">General Education</h2>
        
        <p>The EdUHK’s General Education programme prepares students to be active agents of change, by broadening their intellectual horizons, helping them make connections among different areas of knowledge and between their formal studies and life outside the classroom, and strengthening their capacity for sound thinking and good judgement. It offers a varied but balanced mix of individual courses across a range of subject areas and disciplines, set within an integrated structure of (i) General Education Foundation Course, (ii) Experiential Learning, (iii) General Education Breadth Courses, and (iv) University ePortfolio at a total of 22 credit points.</p>
        
        <h3>(i) General Education Foundation Course (4 credit points)</h3>
        
        <p>General Education Foundation Course is a 4-credit point course that will run in Semesters 1 and 2, and will be taken by all first year students at EdUHK. The purpose of the course is to introduce first year students to a range of disciplines and methodologies from the perspectives of senior academics who are experts in their respective fields.</p>     
        
        <h3>(ii) Experiential Learning (6 cps)</h3>
        
        <p>Experiential Learning (EL) is composed of a 3-cp Co-curricular Service Learning Course (CSLC) and a 3-cp Experiential Learning Course (ELC) which will be offered by departments under the GE domain. Students have to take one of each component for fulfilling the EL (6 cps) requirement.</p>  
          
        <p>The 3-cp CSLC provides students with an opportunity to engage in learning in action and through co-curricular learning activities with direct service elements in real-life or work-place context while complementing, connecting with, and mirroring their learning experiences derived from formal curriculum. The 3-cp ELC encourages students to learn through experimentation, observation, reflection and (re-) conceptualization while undertaking a wide variety of activities, such as creative work, field studies, projects, thematic overseas trips, outward-bound training etc. These courses enrich students’ learning experiences and skills through learning, thinking and reflecting on practice, in practice and for practice, while exposing them to authentic and real-life contexts.</p>  
           
        <p>CSLCs and ELCs will be made available for all undergraduate students, except the final year of non-BEd programmes.</p>      
             
        <h3>(iii) General Education Breadth Courses (9 credit points)</h3>
        
        <p>Under the new curriculum (from 2019/20 onwards), the General Education Breadth Courses (GEBCs) (9 cps) are composed of General Education Breadth Learning Strands (1-3) (GELS) (Level 1-2), Positive and Values Education (PAVE) Course and General Education Interdisciplinary Course (GEIC) (Level 4), students have to take one of each component for fulfilling the GEBCs (9 cps) requirement.</p>  
          
        <p>These courses aim to equip students better for the study of the ontological, epistemological and/or methodological issues in a wide variety of disciplines. Side by side with these existing components, a new 3-cp GEIC (Level 4) will be offered on cross-faculty and/ or cross-departmental basis for students from Year 2 Semester 2 to Year 3, in order to enable them to appreciate the complexity of issues and problems that transcend disciplinary boundaries and make sense of them through dialogues across or integration of disciplines.</p>  
           
        <p>Students are allowed to take GELS and PAVE Course after the completion of GEFC or concurrently with GEFC in Year 1 Semester 2 if they are interested and their curriculum schedules allow. After the completion of any GELS or PAVE Course, students are allowed to take the GEIC from Year 2 Semester 2 to Year 3.</p>      

        <h3>(iv) University ePortfolio (3 credit points)</h3>
        
        <p>After the completion of these courses, students will take a 3-cp course at Consolidation Level to complete their University ePortfolios normally before the final year. Based on their on-going evidence-based reflections on learning since Year One through Years Two-Three/Four, students are required to complete the construction of their University ePortfolios that are made up of the artifacts and evidence derived from a wide variety of learning experiences (e.g. Language Enhancement, GEFC, GELS, PAVE Course and GEIC, Majors, Minors/Electives, Field Experience/Internship, Exchange Programme, CSLCs, ELCs etc.). It provides an intellectual platform for students to synthesize their learning experiences garnered from the academic journey at the EdUHK by critically reflecting on the values and significance of what they have learned, making connections to their lives, and charting or imagining their own future. </p>  
                  

        
        <h2 id="009">Language Enhancement</h2>

        <p>Students take two mandatory credit-bearing English enhancement courses during the first two years of studies as part of the English enhancement programme. These two courses will equip students with the academic literacy skills essential to their study at tertiary level. They will also receive 60 hours of mandatory non-credit-bearing English enhancement courses in Year 1 and 2. Optional IELTS preparation workshops will be held periodically on demand.</p>

        <p>Besides, students are also required to study three Chinese enhancement courses and up to two Putonghua enhancement courses depending on their level. The Chinese enhancement programme consists of one mandatory credit-bearing course in Year 1 and two mandatory non-credit-bearing courses in subsequent semesters, which provide students with the input on Chinese language skills as well as elements of literature and culture. The Putonghua enhancement programme consists of two mandatory non-credit-bearing courses in Year 1. In addition, students can take up to 120 hours of optional non-credit-bearing Putonghua course after Year 1.</p>
                


        <h2 id="010">Career Prospects/Professional Qualifications</h2>

        <p>Graduates of BSocSc (Honours) in Psychology are eligible to apply for membership in the Hong Kong Psychological Society as well as international psychological associations.
